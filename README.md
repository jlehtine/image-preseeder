Image Preseeder
===============

Image Preseeder is a tool for converting an existing Linux distribution
installation image into a preseeded image suitable for fully non-interactive
automatic installation. It was developed primarily for automating the
installation of Linux virtual machines to be used for automated integration or
acceptance tests.

Image Preseeder can create installation images that allow the resulting
VirtualBox virtual machine to be updated non-interactively from scripts outside
the virtual machine, for example to do automated package installation tests.

Image Preseeder currently supports the following Linux distributions:

  * Debian
  * Ubuntu
